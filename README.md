# Pre-processing code for GFS forecasts and PRISM data 
This mess of a repo contains pre-processing scripts to get a period of GFS forecasts at a single forecast hour and downscale to the 3km grid using the PRISM gridded elevation dataset. 

It was used for a final project for UBC EOSC 510 - Data Analysis for Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science. 

It was made over the course of about a week in a time of little sleep.
